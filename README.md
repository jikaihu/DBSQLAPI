DBSQLAPI is a C++ library for accessing multiple SQL databases (Oracle, MySQL, Redisï¼ŒMemcached...). It uses native APIs of target DBMS so applications developed with SQLAPI++ library run swiftly and efficiently. The product also provides a low-level interface that allows developers to access database-specific features. By encapsulating a vendor's API, SQLAPI++ library acts as middleware and delivers database portability. See details on supporting SQL database servers on different platforms:
