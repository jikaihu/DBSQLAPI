DBSQLAPI is a C++ library for accessing multiple SQL databases (Oracle, MySQL, Redisï¼ŒMemcached...). It uses native APIs of target DBMS so applications developed with DBSQLAPI library run swiftly and efficiently.  By encapsulating a vendor's API, DBSQLAPI library acts as middleware and delivers database portability. 


Why use DBSQLAPI?

DBSQLAPI directly calls native API's of target DBMSs . That's why DBSQLAPI is the fastest way to manage you data.
No need (vs ADO) to install and configure OLEDB and/or ODBC drivers when developing and distributing your applications.
Low-level interface that allows developers to access database-specific features.
DBSQLAPI ships with all the sources.
